# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

FrameShift is a NeoForge 1.21.1 server-side mod for loading and pasting schematics without causing server lag or crashes. Performance safety over speed — the system must degrade gracefully rather than freeze or crash the server.

## Working With This User

The project owner is a Java/modding beginner — do not assume familiarity with NeoForge APIs, Gradle, or Minecraft internals. When explaining or implementing anything:
- Prefer clear, readable code over clever abstractions
- Add a one-line comment to every non-obvious method or field
- Explain NeoForge concepts (event buses, mod containers, config specs, etc.) in plain language when they come up

## Build & Run

```bash
./gradlew build       # compile and package the mod jar
./gradlew runServer   # start a local dev server (stops with 'stop' in console)
./gradlew runClient   # launch the game client for testing
./gradlew runData     # generate JSON data files (models, recipes, etc.)
```

On Windows use `gradlew.bat` instead of `./gradlew`.

## Architecture

### Core Rule
- File parsing: async (off server thread)
- World modification: server thread only, every tick

### Job Model
Each paste operation is a `SchematicPasteJob` with:
- `jobId`, `schematicName`, `level`, `origin`, `state`
- Three queues: block placements → block entities → entities

### Placement Flow
1. Parse schematic file asynchronously
2. Convert to placement task queues
3. Each server tick, drain queues up to configured limits
4. Stop tick early if time budget or server load thresholds are exceeded

### Adaptive Throttling (MSPT-based)
| MSPT | Throughput |
|------|-----------|
| < 35 ms | 100% |
| 35–45 ms | 50% |
| 45–50 ms | 25% |
| > 50 ms | pause |

### Hard Safety Limits
- `maxSchematicVolume = 50_000_000`
- `maxBlocksTotal = 20_000_000`
- `maxConcurrentJobs = 2`
- `maxBlocksPerTick = 2000`, `maxBlockEntitiesPerTick = 100`, `maxEntitiesPerTick = 20`
- `maxMillisPerTick = 8`

### Supported Formats
1. `.schem` (Sponge — primary)
2. `.schematic` (legacy — optional)

Both require full block state, block entity (NBT), and optional entity support.

### Schematic Search Paths
```
worldedit/schematics/
config/worldedit/schematics/
schematics/
config/optimizedschematics/
```
Configurable via `schematicDirectories` in the config file.

## Command Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/schem list` | List available schematics with dimensions, block count, file size |
| `/schem info <name>` | Show dimensions, volume, block entities, estimated paste time |
| `/schem paste <name> [x y z]` | Paste with optional flags: `--ignore-air`, `--include-entities`, `--include-block-entities`, `--rotation`, `--mirror` |
| `/schem status` | Progress, blocks placed/remaining, ETA |
| `/schem cancel/pause/resume <jobId>` | Job lifecycle control |
| `/schem reload` | Reload config |

## Chunk Management
- Preload required chunks before paste begins
- Never place blocks in unloaded chunks
- `chunkRadiusLimit = 8` (configurable)
- `forceLoadChunks = false` by default

## Failure Handling
On chunk unload, lag spike, or manual cancel: pause the job and preserve its state for resumption. Do not discard partial progress.

## Out of Scope (MVP)
- GUI
- Undo/rollback
- Cross-dimension pasting
- Client-side rendering
- Instant paste
